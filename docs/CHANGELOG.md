## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Features and Enhancements

- **Challenge Benchmark Removal**: Removed the Challenge benchmark workflow from the maintained codebase.
- **COD Workflow Retirement**: Removed the deprecated COD workflow, including the utilities for converting disordered structures into ordered representations.
- **MatterGen Comparison Notebook**: Added a MatterGen comparison notebook with P1 space-group handling.
- **New Chili Dataset Support**: Added new Chili dataset training and benchmark workflows.
- **Polymorph Analysis Refresh**: Updated the polymorph analysis workflow with corrected processing.
- **Logit Analysis**: New notebook on how to analyse the model's logits during generation of a crystal for mechanistic understanding `Logits.ipynb`.
- **Loss Landscape Analysis**: New notebook on to show plots of loss ladnscapes as used in the paper appendices.
- **Dataset Cleaning Improvements**: The cleaning script can now add token counts and support the downstream analyses used in `Dataset_stats.ipynb`.
- **Model Availability Updates**: Updated load-and-generate script support to include `mp-20`, `alex-mp-20`, and `chili100k` models and removed the retired COD one.
- **Notebook Plot Utilities**: Released plotting utilities through the notebook utils package with updated plots for v2 of paper.

### For API/direct generation
- **Load-and-Generate Prompt Mapping**: Updated `_load_and_generate.py` so prompt inputs are provided as aligned per-prompt lists rather than implicitly expanding one reduced formula across multiple Z values. Generation inputs should now be passed with a 1:1 mapping across the prompt-defining arguments, example in the updated `X_XRD_TiO2.ipynb` notebook.

### Repo Structure and Testing

- **Notebook Utils Reorganization**: Split `_utils/_notebook_utils.py` into the `_utils/_notebook_utils/` package, with notebook-specific modules and shared utilities.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed dead code left behind by retired workflows.
- **Maintained Workflow**: Updated tests and coverage for the maintained generation, preprocessing, and metrics workflows.
- **Project Metadata**: Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, refreshed GitHub workflows, and introduced a new `pyproject.toml`.

### Reproducibility and Branching

- **Repository Split**: this standalone `CrystaLLM-pi-paper` repository preserves the paper-reproduction workflow (v2 on `main`, v1 on `paper_v1`) and therefore excludes the post-paper generation and validation updates introduced on the maintained zoo repository: redundant transition-score removal during perplexity ranking, extra validity checks, full-batch perplexity scoring before slicing to `target_valid_cifs`, and stricter formula-consistency handling. The zoo repository [`CrystaLLM-pi`](https://github.com/C-Bone-UCL/CrystaLLM-pi) remains the maintained package.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Features and Enhancements

- **Virtual Crystal Generator**: disordered-material (partial occupancy) generation support was introduced here as `_utils/_virtualiser/` (developed by [Dr Ricardo Grau-Crespo](https://github.com/rgraucrespo)). This post-paper utility now lives in the maintained [CrystaLLM-pi](https://github.com/C-Bone-UCL/CrystaLLM-pi) repository and is not part of this reproduction repo.

### Efficiency improvements & Dependency Changes
- **In Generation Script**: Fixed redundant transition scoring calls in generate with perplexity ranking, improves generation speed without affecting any outputs or score outputs (backwards compatible)
- **W&B Update**: To v0.25.0

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Features and Enhancements

- **New Conditional Model Integration**: Added support for the Mattergen-XRD model.
- **Reduced Formula Search (`_load_and_generate.py`)**: New `--search_zs` flag sweeps Z=1–4 automatically. With perplexity ranking it evaluates all Z values and returns the lowest-perplexity outputs.  Without ranking it exits early on the first valid CIF. Z can also be set directly if known. Amount of CIFs returned per prompt is controlled by `--target_valid_cifs`.
- **Improved Perplexity Ranking**: Batch processing now scores the full batch before slicing to `target_valid_cifs`, ensuring the best structures are returned rather than just the first valid ones.
- **Multi-GPU Generation**: Added multi-GPU support to `_load_and_generate.py`.
- **Automated XRD Preprocessing**: Converts user XRD patterns from any primary radiation wavelength to the model's expected CuKα automatically. Trims to the 20 most intense peaks, filters 2theta to 0–90 and intensities to 0–100, and sorts from most to least intense. Users only need to provide peak-picked data.

### Bug Fixes

- **CIF Structural Validation**: Formula hecks now also use composition derived directly from the 3D structure object and compared against CIF tags, correctly handling fractional occupancies and rejecting invalid 0.0 or not integer site occupancies.

### Repo Structure and Testing

- Docker/Apptainer containerisation and the REST API introduced in this release now live in the maintained [CrystaLLM-pi](https://github.com/C-Bone-UCL/CrystaLLM-pi) repository and are not part of this reproduction repo.
