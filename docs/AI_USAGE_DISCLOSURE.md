# AI Usage Disclosure

This document records how generative AI was used while developing this codebase, which is kept as the frozen reproduction of the paper (arXiv:2511.21299). Assistance ranged from code completion early on to supervised agent-driven edits later. I recheck and validate all the code: every change, AI-assisted or not, was reviewed, tested and validated by me before it entered the repository, and the architectural and design decisions are mine.

## 1. Tools Used

Used in sequence: Copilot early on, Codex for about two months, Claude Code since.

*   **GitHub Copilot:** in-editor code completion and agents.
*   **Codex (OpenAI):** agent-driven edits with GPT-5.5 and 5.6.
*   **Claude Code (Anthropic):** agent-driven edits, using Claude 4- and 5-family models (Sonnet, Opus, Fable).

## 2. Where AI Was Applied and What It Did

*   **Code:** scaffolding boilerplate and repetitive patterns, refactoring and parallelisation help, and improving syntax and variable names.
*   **Documentation:** drafting docstrings from existing logic and README sections. I edited and fact-checked the output.
*   **Tests:** suggesting edge cases and test scenarios, and drafting some test scaffolding. I decide what gets tested, review every test, and run the suites myself.
*   **Planning:** untracked working documents (plans, audits, proposals) used to organise the work.

## 3. Verification and Accountability

Responsibility for the correctness, scientific validity and stability of this project is mine, the author's.

*   **Review:** I read and validate every AI-assisted diff before it is committed. Nothing merges unreviewed.
*   **Testing:** the local and containerised test suites run against every change, by me and in CI.
*   **Output Validation:** model outputs and pipeline behaviour are rechecked against expected behaviour.
*   **Design:** the study design, the model configurations and the evaluation strategy are my decisions.

## 4. Boundaries

*   Agent-driven edits run only under my prompts and review. No AI-generated change lands without my validation.
*   No result, metric or benchmark number reported in the paper is AI-generated. All come from runs I executed and checked.
